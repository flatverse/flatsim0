* have some sort of draw mode system for easy map wide "swapping" of drawable packs

(slopes)
* create a new namespace for 45 deg angle style slopes
* Add support for slope height through a TilePerspectiveAdjuster
* Add a new type of DrawablePack extender (or maybe just TileTexture) that handles slopes.

TilePerspective
* account for scale in .getTilePixelPosition
* make sure .getCenterCoord is correct

TileMap
* add settings that make it so only tiles on or close to the screen get updated/drawn
* WAY DOWN THE LINE - it would be cool if TileMaps could aggregate other TileMaps by using pre-rendered textures.
* update and especially draw based on direction facing

Tile
* add way to remove tile sections.

TileSection
* add support for an onUpdate callback
